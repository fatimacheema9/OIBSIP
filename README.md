TASK1

Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differ according to their
measurements.  you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to
their species, and we are  training a machine learning model that can learn from the
measurements of the iris species and classify them.

TASK 2

The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car,
features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price
prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So if you want to learn
how to train a car price prediction model then this project is for you.

TASK3

Weâ€™ve all been the recipients of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email
that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic
messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.

In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to
train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam.
